# Nano
A 2 Day project.
The first ever game I worked on at the "Global Game Jam" in 2020.
Team members included: Eric Lin (myself), James Harding, Martin Harriott, Yodhin Singh, and Daniel Hayward

In this game, you play as an anti-virus that travels around a motherboard, removing viruses and repairing the computer.
